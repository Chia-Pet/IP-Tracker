# IP-Tracker

A web-based tool to track IP setups, MAC bindings, and reservations for DHCP and static IP addresses.
This project is designed to simplify and improve the management of IP allocations internally, providing a cleaner, searchable interface with role-based access control.
Currently a functional prototype, built with PHP, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and JSON storage (MySQL integration planned).
